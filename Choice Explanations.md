# Choice Explanations!
  - Made it public as there is no personal information included. It is also easier to grade apparently.
  - MIT license was chosen as it allows the reuse of code and it fits the academic profile of this repo. 
  - I choose to NOT include a README as I believe this code does not require further description.
  - This page was added to explain the choices I made when it came to the creation of this repository.
